        Class for representing a plugin in IDA.

        All plugin should be instantiated only once. For adding a plugin the
        :class:`BipPluginManager` should be used (it can be recuperated using
        the :func:`get_plugin_manager` function).
        The following code can be used for loading a new plugin:

        .. code-block:: python

            class MyPlugin(BipPlugin): # define a new class for the plugin
                pass # implementation

            bpm = get_plugin_manager() # get the BipPluginManager
            bpm.addld_plugin("MyPlugin", MyPlugin, ifneeded=True) # add the plugin

        Once finish developping a :class:`BipPlugin` it can be directly
        set in the ``bipplugin`` folder for being loaded at start by the
        :class:`BipPluginManager`, in that case there is no need to call the
        :meth:`~BipPluginManager.addld_plugin`. The :meth:`BipPlugin.to_load`
        method can be rewritten for deciding when to load or not the plugin
        and the :meth:`BipPlugin.load` method allow to make actions directly
        when the plugin is loaded. :class:`BipActivity` and the associated
        decorators (:func:`menu`, :func:`shortcut`, ...) can be used for
        registering actions in IDA.

        .. note:: **BipPlugin and BipActivity**

            All :class:`BipPlugin` have an attribute ``_activities``
            corresponding to a dict of ``name`` (corresponding to the orginal
            name of the method) as key and with objects which inherit from
            :class:`BipActivity`. This dictionary is created by the
            constructor of this object and the activities are launch when
            the plugin is loaded.
